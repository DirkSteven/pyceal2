# PyCeal

<br> Due to the growth of technology falsification, of Identification (ID) can now be easily done, making ID‚Äôs less secured than ever before. Counterfeit IDs can make it easier for someone to enter school premises or company buildings that can cause danger for people.  PyCeal is an innovative way to create a secured and cannot be replicated ID system by utilizing steganography to embedded hidden data or information that can be only accessed by authorized individuals. It can also be used to read and scan images that have embedded data or information to know if the ID being given is authentic and not a fabricated one.

1. ID-image Generator: One of the features of this product is the ability to create identification card images. These images include a photo of the person, as well as their personal information such as name, date of birth, and ID number.

2. Secured ID-image: the generated output goes a step further in terms of security by incorporating image steganography; an image that contains hidden information or data that can only be accessed by authorized individuals. 

3. Embed specific "message" in an image: Another feature of this product allows for the embedding of a specific message or authentication code within the image. However, this feature is only accessible to university administrators. It can be utilized to indicate an individual's position within the university.

4. ID-Scanner: The last feature allows it to read and scan and images to seek for concealed information. This will make it easier to verify that the file is authentic and not a falsification.

[1] ***An electronic signature should be uploaded on a white background to make the conversion to transparent PNG easier.***

[2] ***It is advised for users to submit PNG files for their image uploads as it can keep quality better and work well with detailed, high-contrast photos. The files size is also significantly larger, addressing any potential data shortage.***
